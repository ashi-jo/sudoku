Sudoku solver ( algorithm + gui)

Some cool features (pretty essential for a sudoku game to have but still cool) :

- You can first insert the numbers you think will go in the cell, and press (num + ENTER) to insert your final number in the cell.
- When you enter a correct number in the cell, it will erase all the 'temporary entries' of that number in it's row , column and box
- Everytime you enter a wrong entry, it is recorded and displayed in crosses(‚ùå)
- It will also record the time you took to solve the puzzle and display it during and at the end.
